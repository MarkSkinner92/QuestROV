## Custom ROV Extension for BlueOS
The purpose of this extension is to drive a custom non-ardupilot ROV using BlueOS.

------------

**Overview:**

Most information about the file structure can be found in the BlueOS extension docs.

Here, app.py runs a simple Flask server, which hosts a webpage on port 5000. This webpage is used as the source of an iFrame widget in Cockpit. It has a persistant websocket connection for teleoperation. 

app.py is also connected via ZeroMQ to several other python scripts inside the controlScripts directory (see controlScripts/README in  for how that works). This allows modularity, enabliling clean and reliable communication with the serial port, and various I2C busses.

The python programs are started by a supervisord call, which is the entrypoint of the docker container.

------------

**Developing**
Clone this repo, including it's submodules.
install all python modules listed in requirements.txt (look in dockerfile to see a quick way)
run each python script individualy, or run `supervisord -n`  to start them all (look in the config file to see which scripts will be started)

**Build & run locally with Docker**
`docker build . -t testflask`
`docker run -p 5000:5000 --privileged testflask`
`docker run -p 5000:5000 --privileged -v /usr/blueos/extensions/QuestROV:/QuestROV/configuration testflask`

**Build to Docker Hub**
`docker build . -t markskinner92/testflask:latest --output type=registry` Replace destination with your own.
